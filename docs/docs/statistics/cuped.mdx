# Regression Adjustment (CUPED)

:::tip

Regression Adjustment (CUPED) is only implemented for the Frequentist statistics engine, and is a premium feature.

GrowthBook aims to unlock high-velocity, enterprise-scale experimentation. Regression adjustment (also known as CUPED, short for Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) is one way to increase the velocity of experimentation by reducing the uncertainty in estimates of experiment uplift.

### How does it work?

Regression adjustment (RA) in general uses data correlated with a metric to reduce our uncertainty about that metric and the statistics we compute. Any data correlated with the metric of interest, but uncorrelated with variation assignment can be used. GrowthBook (and many others) use pre-experiment data, as metrics collected before an experiment will not be affected by said experiment. In fact, the very name CUPED embeds this concept of using pre-experiment data. Using this pre-experiment data, we can fit a simple model to predict our outcome metric and use those predictions to adjust our metric. The adjusted metric then tends to have lower variance.

The more correlated the pre-experiment data is with your metric of interest, the more variance reduction you can achieve. For example, the following plot demonstrates the difference in the distribution of a metric before adjustment ("Normal") and after adjustment ("Adjusted"). The difference in the panels shows that the difference between the normal and adjusted metric is greater when correlation is higher. In both cases, the adjustment is reducing the variance of the metric, but in the higher correlation case, the variance reduction is going to be greater.

In simpler terms, if we know a particular user tends to buy a lot of products on your website before you launch an experiment, we can use that information to understand whether purchase behavior after an experiment is driven by that customers innate tendency to buy a lot of products or whether it was due to the experiment.

The concept of regression adjustment has been around for a long time, but you should feel free to read more in the original CUPED paper ([Deng et al. 2013](https://exp-platform.com/Documents/2013-02-CUPED-ImprovingSensitivityOfControlledExperiments.pdf)), a more general purpose paper on the underpinnings of regression adjustment from a sampling perspective ([Lin 2013](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-7/issue-1/Agnostic-notes-on-regression-adjustments-to-experimental-data--Reexamining/10.1214/12-AOAS583.full)), and any of the many blog posts on the topic (e.g. [Booking.com](https://booking.ai/how-booking-com-increases-the-power-of-online-experiments-with-cuped-995d186fff1d), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/experimentation-platform-exp/articles/deep-dive-into-variance-reduction/)).

## GrowthBook's implementation

GrowthBook takes a transparent, simple approach to CUPED.

For each metric you analyze, we use the metric itself from the pre-exposure period as the correlated data. This tends to be very powerful for metrics that are frequently produced by users (e.g. engagement measures), but can be less powerful if your metric is rare, or if you are measuring behavior for new users. In general, CUPED is more powerful the more you know about your units of interest and the longer they have been able to generate the metric that you are analyzing as a part of your experiment.

We then use the standard CUPED estimator for each variation mean,
$$\bar{Y}_{adjusted} = \bar{Y}_{post} - \theta * \bar{Y}_{pre},$$

where $\bar{Y}_{post}$ is the post-exposure metric average, $\bar{Y}_{pre}$ is the pre-exposure metric average, and $\theta$ is essentially a regression coefficient from a regression of the post-experiment data on the pre-experiment data (pooled across both the control and treatment variation of interest), $\theta = \text{Cov}(Y_{pre}, Y_{post}) / \text{Var}(Y_{pre})$.

Technically, we could use any correlated data instead of $Y_{pre}$. For example, we could use some model that includes all pre-exposure metrics added to your experiment, or auxiliariy dimension information you have configured per user. However, one downside of these approaches is that your results for metric A will depend on whether or not you add a metric B to your experiment and our analysis pipeline would lose its modularity, where each metric can be processed in parallel. Nonetheless, we anticipate continuing to build methods that leverage additional data to improve variance reduction from CUPED.

### Lookback window

GrowthBook defaults to using 14 days of pre-exposure data, but this is customizable at the organization, metric, and metric-experiment level.

Why use a longer lookback window?

- A longer window can be better if your metric is low frequency and a longer window is needed to capture meaningful user behavior that will be correlated across the pre- and post-exposure time periods

Why use a shorter lookback window?

- Shorter lookback windows will yield more performant queries (fewer days to scan from your metric source)
- Behavior in the days just before a user enters an experiment is likely to be more highly correlated with behavior during an experiment, as users change over time. Of course, this is mostly true for metrics that are observed at a higher frequency (e.g. simple engagement metrics).

### Availability

CUPED works for all metrics that are analyzed using the Frequentist engine, except for:

- Ratio metrics where the denominator is a count metric
- Metrics with custom user value aggregations
- Metrics from MixPanel data sources
